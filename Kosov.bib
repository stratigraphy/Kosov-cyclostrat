  abstract = {The type-Silurian Cellon section in the Carnic Alps in Austria underpins much of the current Silurian conodont zonations, forming the basis for the Silurian timescale. However, the Silurian record of the Cellon section lacks radiometric and astrochronological age constraints, making it difficult to gain insights into the processes pacing Silurian (anoxic) events. To attain age constraints and investigate the pacing Silurian (anoxic) events by astronomical cycles, a cyclostratigraphic study was conducted on high-resolution pXRF (CaO, Al2O3, and Fe2O3) and induration records spanning the Ludlow and Pridoli parts of the Cellon section. Astronomical cycles ranging from precession to the 405-kyr eccentricity cycle were first recognised visually in the field and in proxy records. The visual detection of astronomical cycles served as an input for the WaverideR R package, enabling the tracking of the 405-kyr eccentricity period in each proxy's continous wavelet transform scalograms. These tracked period curves were combined with external age controls through multiple Monte Carlo simulations, generating an (absolute) age model. This age model is used to assign ages and durations and their respective uncertainties to a hiatus in the Ludfordian, conodont zones, lithological units, geochronological units and events, yielding new ages for Silurian stage boundaries (e.g., Gorstian-Ludfordian boundary at 425.92 ± 0.65 Ma, the Ludfordian-Pridoli boundary at 423.03 ± 0.53 Ma, the Silurian-Devonian boundary at 418.86 ± 1.02 Ma), and new durations for the Ludfordian at 2.89 ± 0.35 Myr and Pridoli at 4.24 ± 0.46 Myr. Furthermore, the imprint of astronomical cycles in the Cellon section itself indicates that the Linde, Klev and Silurian-Devonian boundary events all occur after a 2.4-Myr eccentricity node, indicating pacing by astronomical forcing, similar to other Devonian and Cretaceous anoxic events. The Lau event, however, does not appear to coincide with a 2.4-Myr eccentricity node.},

  abstract = {Central Europe consists of a complex mosaic of more or less independent terranes with varying tectonometamorphic histories, usually also of different lithological compositions and protolith, and thus it is reasonable to suppose that the majority of these blocks have experienced somewhat different palaeogeographical evolution. The present terrane juxtaposition has been interpreted in general as a result of the Variscan collision of peri-Gondwanan and peri-Baltic derived terranes, with Gondwana on one side and Baltica and/or Laurentia on the other side. However, reconstruction of the pre-Variscan development and mutual palaeogeographical relationships remains a major challenge of interpretation.}

  abstract = {The Ludfordian (late Silurian) records one of the largest perturbations in the Phanerozoic marine carbon cycling, the mid-Ludfordian positive δ13Ccarb excursion (MLCIEcarb), which occurred in the aftermath of the Lau/Kozlowskii Bioevent (LKB). There are still controversies regarding origin of the MLCIE and its possible causal link(s) with respect to the preceding LKB. Surprisingly, the isotope fractionation of carbon between inorganic and organic carbon pools during the MLCIE was not investigated in detail. To constrain better this parameter of marine C cycle, its linkage to the LKB, and local sulfur cycle, we analysed high-resolution δ13Ccarb, δ13Corg, and δ34Spy records in the Prague Basin (peri-Gondwana) representing one of the most complete records of the MLCIEcarb in the world. Evaluation of these high-resolution δ13Corg and δ13Ccarb records reveals their tight coupling, which in turn indicates the photosynthetic origin of the MLCIEorg via links to primary production and changing rates of organic carbon burial. On the other hand, our data also reveal a short-term decoupling of the δ13Corg and δ13Ccarb records preceding the MLCIE which may have been related to a purported increase in atmospheric pCO2 levels or anoxic event. The peak of the Δ13C anomaly exactly coincides with the LKB and, therefore, for the first time suggests a tight link between the change in marine carbon cycling and the bioevent. Subsequent rapid drop of the Δ13C values (and by inference also atmospheric pCO2) fits well with a rapid cooling and globally documented regression reported for this time interval. Finally, the documented strong coupling of δ13Ccarb and δ34Spy records during the MLCIE points to an intensive microbial sulfate reduction which should increase carbonate alkalinity input, thus contributing to formation of authigenic carbonates and an increase in δ13C values of DIC (and anticipated seawater carbonate saturation). The coupling of δ13Corg and δ34Spy values suggests a global enhancement of organic carbon and pyrite burial likely driven by an expansion of euxinic (anoxic and sulfidic water column) conditions in the oceans. Present study of C and S isotope variations during the MLCIE reveals for the first time a tight link among carbon and sulfur cycling, global cooling, and reorganization of faunal communities and fits well with purported seawater carbonate hypersaturation at the onset and during MLCIE.},

  abstract = {The present study reviews the main geochemical, sedimentological, and paleontological events associated with one of the largest perturbations in the Phanerozoic carbon cycle, the Mid-Ludfordian Carbon Isotope Excursion (MLCIE), which is globally documented in late Silurian marine successions. Climate changes associated with the MLCIE are not yet well documented in contrast to most other Silurian CIEs. We report seawater surface temperature changes across the entire MLCIE using δ18Oapatite records of conodonts originating from different regions located in temperate as well as tropical paleolatitudes. Significant positive δ18Oapatite excursions (up to 3.8‰) measured in temperate-water areas of the Prague Basin and Carnic Alps (peri-Gondwana) as well as in the tropical areas of Baltica (Laurussia) and Australia (Gondwana) provide evidence for significant global cooling during the MLCIE. The marked cooling of sea surface temperatures, coupled with a significant eustatic sea-level fall recorded on all corresponding paleocontinents, point to a major glaciation in polar and subpolar Gondwana which is denominated here as the “Mid-Ludfordian Glaciation”. The onset of rapid cooling in the Prague Basin (peri-Gondwana) is preceded by the deposition of shales enriched in redox-sensitive trace metals suggesting that anoxic/euxinic waters expanded on the deeper carbonate shelf just before the MLCIE. The coincidence of culmination of the anoxic event (named here as the Siluricus Ocean Anoxic Event) with the Lau/Kozlowskii extinction events is documented for the first time outside of the Laurussian epeiric basins. Widespread oxygen-deficient conditions are interpreted to have been stressful to shelfal ecosystems and may have been a major cause of the extinctions. The mid-Ludfordian glacio-eustatic sea-level fall caused a reduction of shelf habitats culminating in a lower faunal diversity and a change in the structure of faunal communities. The observed positive δ18Oapatite excursion is tightly coupled to δ13C and δ34S anomalies documented from temperate (peri-Gondwana) as well as tropical (Laurussia) paleolatitudes. The δ18Oapatite data complete the Silurian seawater temperature curve and show evidence that one of the largest positive carbon isotope anomalies (MLCIE) of the Phanerozoic was preceded by a widespread anoxic event and tightly linked with a climate cooling event as documented as well for most other Silurian CIEs.},

  abstract = {The identification of Milankovitch cycles and the establishment of a high-resolution astronomical time scale for the Palaeozoic represent a research frontier in cyclostratigraphy and astrochronology. A continuous core drilled through the Telychian Stage (Llandovery, Silurian) of the Pasłek Formation in the Baltic Basin (Poland) is characterized by repetitive centimetre-scale alternations of homogeneous greenish-grey mudstones and faintly laminated dark-grey-to-black mudstones. Such lithological rhythmicity reflects a cyclical variation in redox conditions at the sediment-water interface, and therefore was used to construct a floating astronomical time scale (ATS) for the Telychian Stage. The cyclostratigraphic analysis was performed on a 5 mm resolution greyscale scan based upon photographs of the slabbed core, with lower values associated with greenish-grey mudstones and higher values related to dark-grey-to-black mudstone facies. Spectral density estimation by means of the multitaper method (MTM) reveals significant peaks rising above the 95\% red noise confidence level that we interpret as the 405-kyr long-eccentricity, short-eccentricity, obliquity and precession components. The MTM evolutive power spectral analysis (EPSA) shows a gradual increase in the velocity of sedimentation from 5.03 m/Myr in the lowermost interval to 5.48 m/Myr towards the uppermost part of the studied sequence. We postulate that the observed cycles reflect orbitally-driven climatic variations from stable wet conditions to monsoon-like high seasonal contrasts that affected weathering intensity, runoff and nutrient supply. These cyclical variations led to rhythmic variations in organic matter fluxes and benthic anoxic conditions. In the analysed record, orbital precession influenced the deposition of the greenish-grey mudstone and dark-grey-to-black mudstone couplets, occurring on average every 10 cm. Furthermore, long-eccentricity modulation of precession controlled the relative depositional predominance of one facies over the other. Observed periodicities resemble those of Cenozoic and Mesozoic orbitally controlled records, thus suggesting that during the Silurian the orbital eccentricity forcing on the carbon flux acted in the same way as in the Cenozoic and Mesozoic. The orbital tuning of the studied interval, calibrated by means of accurate acritarch biostratigraphy, allowed for the estimation of an astronomically calibrated duration for the Telychian Stage of about 5.46 Myr.},

  abstract = {The main cycles of Earth's eccentricity as recorded in paleoclimate archives signify 2nd order terms, combining two g-frequencies associated with the precession of perihelia of the inner planets and Jupiter. However, many weaker cycles are present and may be documented as well. Here we report on a thus far unnoticed 200-kyr cycle observed in rhythmically bedded marine marls and limestones of early Paleocene age in NE Spain and adjacent France. This cycle is expressed as alternating distinct and less distinct 100-kyr CaCO3 maxima and associated magnetic susceptibility (MS) minima, which correspond to successive minima of the short 100-kyr eccentricity cycle. The most plausible explanation is that this 200-kyr cycle represents a weak but real cycle in eccentricity. Due to its weakness, this cycle is only expressed as alternatingly strong and weak 100-kyr minima in eccentricity time series, a pattern that is identical to what we observe in the proxy records and outcrop. Its origin as eccentricity cycle is complex as it is composed of 4 to 6 individual components. A simplified solution solely based on the five leading g-frequencies reveals that most of these components originate from combinations of these 5 frequencies. However, they do not correspond to 2nd order terms, which underlie the principal short and long eccentricity cycles, but to much weaker higher order terms. Three of them have been identified as 4th order terms and two as 6th order terms, representing combinations of 2nd order terms, such as the first harmonic, 2(g2 – g5), of the 405-kyr cycle and related components. It is for the first time that the combined effect of such weak components has been identified in paleoclimatic records, which is only possible because they are not overwhelmed by much stronger 2nd order terms in this frequency band. Finally, the typical pattern that results from interference with the much stronger 100-kyr cycle might be used as a template for testing the accuracy of astronomical solutions in the future.},

  abstract = {During the late Silurian the Prague Basin was located in middle southern latitudes. In contrast to palaeocontinents positioned in tropical and subtropical latitudes like Baltica, no reefs are developed, which is in accordance with the predicted cooler water. The Prague Basin represents a relatively restricted and shallow rift basin with a complex tectonic history. Sections in different palaeoenvironments have been studied to document the most prominent Silurian stable carbon isotope excursion recorded during the late Silurian (Ludfordian) Lau Event from this part of peri-Gondwana. Deeper water deposits of the Kopanina Formation investigated in the present study were deposited on the slope-to-basin transition near the Kosov volcanic centre in the western part of Prague Basin. The sediments are developed as an alternation of dark, partly laminated limestones and marls with an increase of the limestone-marl ratio in the upper part of the succession. A pronounced positive carbon isotope excursion starts in the Neocullograptus kozlowskii graptolite and in the upper Polygnathoides siluricus conodont zone. The maximum of the shift is observed in the lower part of an interval characterised by the Ananaspis fecunda-Cyrthia postera community. The maximum values scatter around 8‰, which represent the highest values reported hitherto from the Prague Basin. In low latitudes, often a decrease of δ13C values towards deeper water settings is reported. In contrast, in the present study the δ13C values of about 8‰ are much higher than those recorded from the contemporaneous shallow-water sections studied in the classical Mušlovka and Požáry quarries. The most reasonable explanation is the presence of stratigraphical gaps in the shallow parts of the basin. As indicated by karstification these gaps were caused by a sea-level drop. Another effect of this sea-level fall was a strongly reduced sedimentation of the cephalopod limestone facies around volcanic and tectonic elevations. © 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

To address this mystery, we develop a sedimentary noise model for sea-level changes that simultaneously estimates geologic time and sea level from astronomically forced marginal marine stratigraphy. The noise model involves two complementary approaches: dynamic noise after orbital tuning (DYNOT) and lag-1 autocorrelation coefficient (ρ 1). Noise modeling of Lower Triassic marine slope stratigraphy in South China reveal evidence for global sea-level variations in the Early Triassic hothouse that are anti-phased with continental water storage variations in the Germanic Basin. This supports the hypothesis that long-period (1-2 myr) astronomically forced water mass exchange between land and ocean reservoirs is a missing link for reconciling geological records and models for sea-level change during non-glacial periods.},

These intervals correspond to periods of high-amplitude variations in the tilt (obliquity) of the Earth's axis, connected with a 1.2 myr cycle, and to sea-level lowstands of third-order eustatic cycles in the Haq et al. (1987) curve. This implies that the development of major Plio-Pleistocene glaciations proceeded episodically and that third-order cycles are glacio-eustatically controlled. In (at least) two of these intervals sinistrally-coiled neogloboquadrinids entered the Mediterranean at times of glacial periods. One interval starts around 2.8 Ma and is characterized by the first occurrence of N. atlantica (s). Another interval begins at the Plio-Pleistocene boundary around 1.8 Ma and is characterized by the common occurrence of sinistrally-coiled N. pachyderma. Also during the late Miocene third-order cycles correlate well with the 1.2 myr cycle of obliquity. A significant drop in the third-order eustatic curve starting at the Tortonian-Messinian boundary, for instance, coincides with a period of high-amplitude variations in the obliquity time series connected with the 1.2 myr cycle.}

  abstract = {Eccentricity cycles often exert a strong influence on sedimentary series, while they only have weak powers in the insolation series. Three case studies previously published in Early Cretaceous hemipelagic marl-limestone alternations of the Tethyan area are reviewed here to evaluate possible mechanisms of transfer of power from the precession to the eccentricity band. In all cases, the sedimentation rates vary cyclically, following the 405-kyr and the 2.4-myr eccentricity cycles. Maximums of sedimentation rates occur in more clayey intervals, suggesting a strong eccentricity forcing on detrital supply and consequently on sedimentation rates. In all sections, proxies related to purely detrital input show an overwhelming influence of the 405-kyr and the 2.4-myr eccentricity cycle compared to the other Milankovitch components. Proxies related to the carbonate production show lower amplitudes of the 405-kyr cycle and enhanced 100-kyr eccentricity cycle, which can dominate the power in the Milankovitch band. Memory effects of erosional and pedogenetic processes are proposed as powerful mechanisms of transfer of amplitude from the precession to the eccentricity band. Highly evolved pedogenesis under more humid climates have longer memory effects, which favor the 405-kyr and the 2.4-myr cycles in sedimentary series. Changes in phasing between carbonate production and insolation can suppress the low frequencies and favor the dominance of the 100-kyr eccentricity cycle. Consequently, in Tethyan Early Cretaceous deposits, clay-dominated marl-limestone alternations are associated to higher sedimentation rates and higher amplitudes of the long eccentricity cycles. Conversely, carbonate-dominated marl-limestone alternations are associated to lower sedimentation rates and higher amplitudes of the 100-kyr eccentricity cycles.},

  abstract = {When Milankovitch cycles are preserved in the geologic record they provide a direct link between chronometer and climate change, and thus a remarkable opportunity to constrain the evolution of the surficial Earth System. The identification of such cycles has allowed exploration of the geologic record with unprecedented temporal resolution, and has spurred the development of a rich theoretical framework for climatic change. Accompanying these successes, however, has been a persistent skepticism: how does one reliably test for astronomical forcing/pacing in stratigraphic and paleoclimate data, especially when time is poorly constrained? From this perspective, it would seem that the merits and promise of astrochronology – a Phanerozoic time scale measured in 20,000 to 400,000 year increments – also serves as its Achilles heel, if the confirmation of such geologically short temporal rhythms defies rigorous hypothesis testing. The implications are substantial, since much of our understanding of paleoclimate change throughout the Cenozoic (and beyond) is firmly rooted in astrochronologic interpretation. In this study, a conceptual framework for assessing Earth System response to astronomical-insolation changes, and the propagation of that signal into the geologic record, is used as a guide to understand the nature of the problem of astrochronologic testing. This framework emphasizes three challenges – contamination, stratigraphic distortion, and temporal calibration. A statistical optimization method (TimeOpt; Meyers, 2015) is formulated as a solution to these three challenges, providing an approach for astrochronologic testing that objectively evaluates time scale uncertainty while simultaneously identifying an optimal model for climate and depositional system response to astronomical forcing. New extensions to the technique are presented, allowing explicit reconstruction of distortions to the primary forcing that are known to be omnipresent in the stratigraphic record. To illustrate the utility of this approach, it is applied to five well-studied stratigraphic series throughout the Phanerozoic, supporting their astronomical origin, and yielding constraints on the evolution of the Earth System and the astronomical solutions themselves. Future directions that build on this foundation are discussed, including the utility of process-based null models, approaches for Earth System transfer function reconstruction, and mapping out ancient Solar System behavior and Earth-Moon history using the geologic archive of Milankovitch cycles. The TimeOpt approach recognizes astronomy, geochronology, paleoclimatology and depositional system reconstruction as a unified geoscientific inverse problem.},

  abstract = {Cyclostratigraphic analysis has produced fundamental advancements in our understanding of climate change, paleoceanography, celestial mechanics, geochronology, and chronostratigraphy. Of central importance to this success has been the development of astrochronologic testing methods for the evaluation of astronomical-climate influence on sedimentation. Most pre-Pleistocene astrochronologic testing methods fall into one of two categories: (1) those that test for expected amplitude or frequency modulation imposed by an astronomical signal or (2) those that test for bedding hierarchies (frequency ratios or bundling) that are predicted by the dominant astronomical periods. In this study, a statistical methodology for combining these complementary approaches is developed, which identifies the time scale that simultaneously optimizes eccentricity amplitude modulation of the precession band, and the concentration of power at precession (carrier) and eccentricity (modulator) frequencies. The technique is demonstrated to have high statistical power - it is capable of identifying astronomical cycles when present - under a wide range of conditions, and its application to synthetic models illuminates a range of potential pitfalls that are encountered when more conventional nonoptimization approaches are used. The method is also independent from the interpretation of power spectrum peak significance, resolving previous concerns regarding appropriate confidence level assessment and "multiple testing." As two case studies, the algorithm is applied to Miocene strata of Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Site 926B, and the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum-Eocene Thermal Maximum 2 interval at ODP Site 1262. The results verify published cyclostratigraphic interpretations and support the theoretical astronomical solutions. This new astrochronologic testing approach can be used to evaluate cyclostratigraphic records spanning the Phanerozoic and potentially beyond.},

  abstract = {Early Cretaceous (Valanginian-Albian) successions in northwestern Europe occupy an ideal palaeoceanographic location in which to study the interplay between the Arctic-Boreal and Tethyan seaways or realms. Marine Early Cretaceous sediments of the North Sea borderlands (north Germany, eastern England) are dominated by fine-grained siliciclastic deposition with carbonates. Occasionally this succession is characterised by visually striking bedding rhythms, comprising calcareous and less calcareous clays or pale-dark alternations on a scale of 0.5-1 m. Such rhythmic sedimentation becomes most dominant in the early to late Hauterivian, parts of the early Barremian and in the Aptian. This study concentrates on late Hauterivian sections in England and Germany, which have remained relatively unaffected by deep burial, tectonism or diagenesis. Changes in geochemistry are related to floral and faunal alternations and thus directly to palaeoenvironment. The wide range of palaeontological and geochemical analyses show conclusively how bedding rhythms, developed in the Milankovitch band, are the result of palaeoclimate change. Pale layers were 'Tethyan influenced' in their microflora and fauna, indicating warm surface waters that were poor in nutrients and developed during warm, seasonally arid hinterland climates. Dark layers were 'Boreal influenced', displaying features consistent with cooler waters, rich in nutrients. Such dark layers reflect cooler, more humid hinterland conditions. The coincidence of Tethyan taxa with bundles of pale layers displaying high gamma-ray emission and elevated radioactive element contents suggests transgressive or condensed beds. The bundling of pale-dark rhythms coincides with the long-term Milankovitch eccentricity cycle. This paper documents direct links between the reaction of hinterland weathering, marine floras and floras to Milankovitch-scale changes in bed lithology and thickness.},

Palaeogeogr., Palaeoclimatol., Palaeoecol., 49: 237–263. In the subsurface of the East Mediterranean Sea, eleven discrete basin-wide, organic-rich, black sapropels were deposited during the last 465 000 years. They are dated by oxygen isotopic chronostratigraphy. The too.st recent sapropel has been shown to be the consequence of heavy Nile River summer floods due to increased monsoonal summer precipitation over Ethiopia, and not of Scandinavian ice-sheet meltwater influx into the East Mediterranean Sea as was previously believed. While most sapropels were deposited during interglacials, two thick sapropels formed during glacial periods, as shown by their position in the oxygen isotopic stratigraphy and by their pollen record in core RC9-181. The new evidence presented here is that the sapropel sequence in this core, including the two glacial sapropels, correlates on a one-to-one basis with the highest values of an index of insolation on top of the al\textbackslash simmosphere. The concept of this index derives from an analysis of the African monsoon process. The index variation is computed for the last 465 000 years from the caloric northern summer insolation in the tropical latitudes, con-trolled by variations of the Earth's orbital parameters. It is conjectured that this index might be linked through the climate system to the monsoonal precipitation which in Africa produces the Nile River sUmmer flood: INTRODUCTION},

  abstract = {Paleogeography is the study of the changing surface of Earth through time. Driven by plate tectonics, the configuration of the continents and ocean basins has been in constant flux. Plate tectonics pushes the land surface upward or pulls it apart, causing its collapse. All the while, the unrelenting forces of climate and weather slowly reduce mountains to sand and mud and redistribute these sediments to the sea. This article reviews the changing paleogeography of the past 750nbspmillion years. It describes the broad patterns of Phanerozoic paleogeography as well as many of the specific paleogeographic events that have shaped the modern continents and ocean basins. The focus is on the changing latitudinal distribution of the continents, fluctuations in sea level, the opening and closing of oceanic seaways, mountain building, and how these paleogeographic changes have affected global climate, ocean circulation, and the evolution of life. This review presents an atlas of 114 paleogeographic maps that illustrate how Earth's surface has evolved during the past 750nbspmillion years. During that time interval, Earth has witnessed the formation and breakup of two supercontinents: Pannotia and Pangea.

This paper estimates the resulting uncertainties in ancient Milankovitch cycle periods and shows that they lead to: (i) problems with using Milankovitch cycles for accurate measurement of durations (potential errors are around 25\% by the start of the Phanerozoic); (ii) problems with correctly identifying the Milankovitch cycles responsible for observed period ratios (e.g., the ratio for long-eccentricity/short-eccentricity overlaps, within error, with the ratio for short-eccentricity/precession); and (iii) problems with verifying that observed cycles are Milankovitch driven at all (the probability of a random period ratio matching a predicted Milankovitch ratio, within error, is 20–70\% in the Phanerozoic). Milankovitch-derived ages and durations should therefore be treated with caution unless supported by additional information such as radiometric constraints.},
